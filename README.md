☕ Java --Reg-OOps

Welcome to Punith-0’s Java playground, where everything starts simple — like a calculator that just wants to add things up 🧮 — and slowly evolves into a world of OOPs magic ✨.

This repository is my journey from Java basics to Object-Oriented mastery. Expect a mix of logic, learning, and a few typos that I’ll totally call “features.” 😄


🚀 What’s Inside (for now)

Simple Calculator
The humble beginning — it adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides (when it’s in the mood).
Think of it as the origin story of something much greater. 💪


🧭 What’s Coming Next

I’ll be adding more Java concepts step by step:

Variables, loops, and conditionals 🔁

Methods and exception handling ⚠️

Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and all that sweet OOP stuff ☕🐍

Eventually, this repo will become a complete guide from basics to advanced OOPs concepts — all written in Java and sprinkled with a bit of humor.


💡 Why This Repo Exists

Because learning Java is like learning to make coffee — you start with instant, then eventually start brewing your own blend.
This is my brewing station for all things Java.

If you’re on the same learning path, feel free to fork, clone, and code along! 👨‍💻


⚙️ How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Punith-0/JAVA---reg-oops.git



Open it in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse — pick your fighter).

Compile and run the files — and enjoy some console magic ✨


☕ Final Thoughts

Every great developer starts small — and this repo is that first step.
From a simple calculator today to clean, object-oriented designs tomorrow.

Stick around, because “Oops” in Java --Reg-OOps will soon mean Object-Oriented Programming, not accidental bugs! 😅
